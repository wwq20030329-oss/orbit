## Version 7 - 2026-04-08

This preview release expands the current update with the latest Gemini models, a smarter voice onboarding flow, and more reliable Happy CLI sessions for plan approvals and Codex turns.

- Update Happy CLI with `npm i -g happy`
- Added the latest Gemini models to the picker
- Improved voice onboarding with smarter first-run prompts and clearer upgrade guidance for free users
- Fixed Happy CLI plan approval flows so Accept and Reject buttons show up reliably in plan mode

## Version 6 - 2026-03-19

This is the biggest update since launch — a redesigned session creation experience, Git worktree management, expanded agent support.

- New session composer screen with machine selection, worktree picker, draft persistence, and offline machine visibility.
- Git worktree management — list, create, and select worktrees from the app. Worktrees auto-cleanup on session delete.
- Automatic plan mode switching when your agent enters planning mode.
- OpenClaw added as a selectable AI agent alongside Claude Code and Codex.
- Session quick actions for faster interaction with active sessions.
- Session resume support — pick up where you left off.
- Delete sessions directly from the session info screen.
- Renamed "bypass" permission mode to "yolo" with updated styling.
- Improved markdown rendering and message formatting.
- Improved message sync reliability with edge case fixes.
- Various UI polish: send spinner, hidden internal tool calls, improved spacing.

## Version 5 - 2025-12-22

This release expands AI agent support and refines the voice experience, while improving markdown rendering for a better chat experience.

- We are working on adding Gemini support using ACP and hopefully fixing codex stability issues using the same approach soon! Stay tuned.
- Removed model configurations from agents. We were not able to keep up with the models so for now we are removing the configuration from the mobile app. You can still configure it through your CLIs, happy will simply use defaults.
- Elevenlabs ... is epxensive. Voice conversations will soon require a subscription after 3 free trials - we'll soon allow connecting your own ElevenLabs agent if you want to manage your own spendings.
- Improved markdown table rendering in chat - no more ASCII pipes `|--|`, actual formatted tables (layout still needs work, but much better!)
